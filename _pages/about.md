Welcome!  

I am a computational researcher, having recently completed my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at 
[Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/) under the supervision of 
[Andrea Marin](https://www.unive.it/data/people/5592332) and 
[Leonardo Maccari](https://www.unive.it/data/people/21550550).  

My doctoral thesis, *"Optimizing Cloud Computing Performance: Simulation of Finite-Capacity Multi-Server Queueing Systems,"* 
developed an open-source simulation framework for modelling and improving resource allocation in large-scale computing systems.  

During my Ph.D. I also spent a period abroad at 
[NUST Balochistan Campus](https://nbc.nust.edu.pk/) working with 
[Prof. Muhammad Mohsin Raza Jafri](https://nbc.nust.edu.pk/faculty/muhammad-mohsin-raza-jafri/).

My research focuses on **finite-capacity multi-server queuing systems in cloud data centers**, including design and evaluation of novel scheduling and resource allocation strategies.
